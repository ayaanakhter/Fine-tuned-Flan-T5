The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC\\'s founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed \"in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014.\" Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians\\' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday\\'s ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. \"As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice,\" he said, according to an ICC news release. \"Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace.\" Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. \"As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly,\" she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. \"Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court\\'s treaty should speak out to welcome its membership,\" said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. \"What\\'s objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine\\'s decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members.\" In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it \"strongly\" disagreed with the court\\'s decision. \"As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC,\" the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. \"We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace,\" it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as \"Palestine.\" While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would \"conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality.\" The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

The footage showed Diana \nand Dodi step into an elevator at the Ritz Hotel. Images taken from a security camera at the Ritz Hotel in Paris show the \n36-year-old smiling as she and her lover Dodi Fayed step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel.\n\nFurther footage shows Fayed visiting a jeweler's shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an \nengagement ring. Earlier, a British coroner at the inquest said it may never be known for certain whether Princess Diana \nwas pregnant when she died in the Paris car crash. Lord Justice Scott Baker told the jury at the inquest into the deaths \nof the princess and her lover Dodi Fayed that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate \"one way or the other\" \nwhether she was in the early stages of pregnancy. \n\nBut he said they would hear \"intimate\" details of her personal life. Watch footage of Diana's last hours. Baker told \nthe 11 members of the jury -- six women and five men -- Diana may have been on the contraceptive pill and that evidence \nshe was poised to get engaged to Dodi on the night she died was contradictory.\n\"\"\"","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-03-26T18:47:02.406555Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-03-26T18:47:02.406952Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-03-26T18:47:02.411385Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-03-26T18:47:02.406923Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-03-26T18:47:02.410248Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":41},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, T5Tokenizer\n\n\nmodel_path = \"/kaggle/input/fine-tuned-flan-t5\"\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_path, use_safetensors=True)\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)\n\nprint(\" Fine-Tuned Flan-T5 Loaded \")\n\n\ndef summarize_text(text):\n    try:\n        inputs = tokenizer(\"summarize: \" + text, return_tensors=\"pt\", max_length=512, truncation=True)\n        summary_ids = model.generate(\n            **inputs,\n            max_length=256, \n            num_beams=5,  \n            length_penalty=1.2,  \n            no_repeat_ngram_size=3,  \n            early_stopping=True\n        )\n        return tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n    except Exception as e:\n        return f\"Error: {str(e)}\"\n\ngenerated_summary = summarize_text(sample_article)\nprint(\"\\ Generated Summary:\")\nprint(generated_summary)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-03-26T18:47:04.777829Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-03-26T18:47:04.778226Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-03-26T18:47:08.882315Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-03-26T18:47:04.778198Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-03-26T18:47:08.881178Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":" Fine-Tuned Flan-T5 Loaded \n\\ Generated Summary:\nDodi Fayed, 36, died in a car crash at the Ritz Hotel in Paris.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":42},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sample_article = {\n    \"news\": \"\"\"The global economy is experiencing a slowdown due to multiple factors, including inflation, \n    supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions.

Unlike classical mechanics, where objects follow deterministic paths, quantum mechanics introduces probabilistic outcomes dictated by wave functions. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle asserts that one cannot simultaneously determine both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision. Superposition, another core concept, posits that particles exist in multiple states until measured. Entanglement, described by Einstein as \"spooky action at a distance,\" allows two particles to share a state regardless of distance, defying classical notions of locality.\n\nDespite its abstract nature, quantum mechanics underpins modern technologies such as semiconductors, quantum computing, and cryptography. However, the transition from theoretical physics to practical applications presents challenges. Quantum computers, which leverage qubits instead of classical bits, promise exponential speed-ups for certain problems, yet they remain constrained by decoherence and error rates. The ongoing debate between the Copenhagen interpretation, which suggests wave function collapse upon measurement, and the Many-Worlds interpretation, which proposes parallel realities, underscores the philosophical depth of quantum mechanics.\n\nMoreover, recent advancements in quantum field theory and quantum gravity seek to unify general relativity with quantum mechanics, a pursuit that has eluded physicists for decades. The incompatibility between Einstein’s smooth spacetime and quantum fluctuations suggests the need for a deeper framework, potentially involving string theory or loop quantum gravity. Experimental evidence from high-energy particle collisions and cosmological observations may provide clues, yet a complete theory of quantum gravity remains an open question, challenging our fundamental understanding of the universe itself.\"\"\"\n\ngenerated_summary = summarize_text(challenging_text)\nprint(\"Generated Summary:\", generated_summary)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-03-26T18:49:19.495451Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-03-26T18:49:19.496009Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-03-26T18:49:22.947032Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-03-26T18:49:19.495967Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-03-26T18:49:22.946007Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Generated Summary: Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of matter and energy on atomic and subatomic scales.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":43},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
